How to post a google sheets form with html form </br>

Hi first we will need the info from - https://medium.com/@dmccoy/how-to-submit-an-html-form-to-google-sheets-without-google-forms-b833952cc175

While running the original code on my website I got a ton of problems with it so after few versions, this is my final code.  You can see a live preview here - https://shahary.com

We need to creat a new google script in a new google sheet -

Go to the index.html here and copy the rest of the code. 

Write a simple form like the one in the index file. 
The second thing is to geet the - Serialize Object function-

You will need to get the latest jQuery library - http://code.jquery.com
